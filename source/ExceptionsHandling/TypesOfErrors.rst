===========================
Types of program errors
===========================

We distinguish between the following types of errors:

* **Syntax errors:** errors due to the fact that the syntax of the language is not respected.
* **Semantic errors:** errors due to an improper use of program statements.
* **Logical errors:** errors due to the fact that the specification is not respected.

From the point of view of when errors are detected, we distinguish:

* **Compile time errors:** syntax errors and static semantic errors indicated by the compiler.
* **Runtime errors:** dynamic semantic errors, and logical errors, that cannot be detected by the compiler (debugging).
