Python Operators
=====================

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* :ref:`Arithmetic-operators` 
* :ref:`Assignment-operators`
* :ref:`Comparison-operators`
* :ref:`Logical-operators`
* :ref:`Identity-operators`
* :ref:`Membership-operators`
* :ref:`Bitwise-operators`

Arithmetic operators
=====================

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

   :header: Operator, Operation, Example
   :widths: 20, 35, 45
   :file: ../csv/math_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Assignment-operators:

Assignment operators
=====================

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Operator,Example,SameAs
   :widths: 20, 45, 35
   :file: ../csv/assignment_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Comparison-operators:

Comparison operators
=====================

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Operator,Name,Example
   :widths: 20, 35, 45
   :file: ../csv/comparison_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Logical-operators:

Logical operators
==================

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Operators,Description,Example
   :widths: 20, 50, 30
   :file: ../csv/logical_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Identity-operators:

Identity operators
====================

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
   
.. csv-table::
   :header: Operators,Description,Example
   :widths: 20, 50, 30
   :file: ../csv/identity_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Membership-operators:

Membership operators
=====================

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Operators,Description,Example
   :widths: 20, 50, 30
   :file: ../csv/membership_operators.csv
   :align: center

.. _Bitwise-operators:

Bitwise operators
==================

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
   
.. csv-table::
   :header: Operators,Name,Description
   :widths: 20, 30, 50
   :file: ../csv/bitwise_operators.csv
   :align: center
